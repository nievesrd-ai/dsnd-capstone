## Project Overview and Motivation
This is a capstone project to Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. The project is about utilizing Apache Spark to perform Data Science tasks on the ‘Sparkify’ dataset. The Sparkify dataset is a hypothetical user log coming from a music-listening service such as Spotify or Apple Music. The high level goal of the project is to create a prediction model capable of identifying users that are considering to drop their subscription to the music listening service. The music-listening service could utilize the results of the predictive model to send targeted offers in hopes to preserve the user subscription. 

## Project Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
	
	```	
		git clone https://github.com/nievesrd-ai/dsnd-capstone.git
	```
2. Install the necessary Python packages according to `requirements.txt`
3. Open a terminal and run `jupyter notebook` command.
4. In the jupyter notebook file browser, open `Sparkify_RNieves_Final_v1.0.ipynb`
